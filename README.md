# This is a Python implementaiton of Towers of Hanoi game. Find the rules below.

# The script is implementing stacks. Making the game made it more fun to study stacks, I have learnt a lot while working on this.

# Try it out yourself!

# The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The   #puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the #puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:
#
#  Only one disk may be moved at a time.
#  Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
#  No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
#
# With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the #number of disks.
